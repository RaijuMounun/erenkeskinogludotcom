# Base Rules

This file contains the core rules applicable to all projects.  
Each language or framework-specific rule file should reference this file. (E.g. **Note:** This file is to be used together with the base rules located at `Yazilim/.cursor/rules/base-rules.md`.  
Please follow all base rules in addition to the [language/framework]-specific rules below.)

## Core Rules
- The codebase must always be clean, well-organized, and easy to read.
- All code must strictly follow the style guide of the chosen language or framework.
- The project architecture should be robust, maintainable, and scalable. The architecture must be in enterprise-level.
- All code must adhere to SOLID principles and be modular.
- Code should be well-documented, including both inline comments and external documentation.
- All code must be covered by automated tests where applicable.
- Code reviews are mandatory before merging any changes.
- Avoid code duplication (DRY principle).
- Follow best practices for performance and security.
